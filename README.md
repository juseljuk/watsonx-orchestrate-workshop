## A Hands-On Workshop for Agentic AI Development

Welcome! This workshop will guide you through building AI agents using IBM watsonx Orchestrate. You'll use IBM Bob, an AI coding assistant, to help you along the way.

## Workshop Overview

**Duration:** 190-220 minutes

**Level:** Beginner to Intermediate

**Prerequisites:** 
- Computer with internet access, Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system, at least 8GB RAM and 500 MB of free disk space
- Basic Python knowledge and Python 3.11-3.13 installed (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- uv installed (https://pypi.org/project/uv/)
- watsonx Orchestrate SaaS access (provided by your instructor or you can use your own)
- IBM Bob IDE installed (trial or one provided by your instructor)

## What You'll Build

Throughout this workshop, you'll build progressively more sophisticated AI agents:

### 1. Hello World Agent (Part 2)
Your first simple agent to understand the basics of agent configuration and behavior.

### 2. Customer Support System (Parts 3-5)
A complete customer support solution featuring:
- **Custom Python tools** for order status checking and refund processing
- **Knowledge base integration** for FAQ handling
- **Specialized escalation agent** for complex issues
- **Safety guidelines and guardrails** for responsible AI

### 3. Product Catalog System (Part 6)
An **MCP server-powered agent** that demonstrates backend integration:
- Product search and details
- Inventory checking
- Product recommendations
- Reusable MCP server architecture

### 4. Travel Planning System (Part 7)
A **multi-agent orchestration** showcasing advanced patterns:
- **Travel Concierge** (orchestrator) - Intelligent routing
- **Flight Specialist** - Flight bookings and search
- **Hotel Specialist** - Accommodation management
- **Activity Planner** - Local activities and attractions
- **Budget Advisor** - Cost analysis and optimization

Each system builds on concepts from previous parts, teaching you to create increasingly sophisticated agentic AI solutions.
